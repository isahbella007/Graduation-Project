# Graduation-Project
About this Project
The aim of the project is to develop a centralized food ordering system which will provide easy
access to both restaurant owners and customers. This system will bridge the gap between big
restaurants and smaller ones who are limited by advertisement and web-presence resources; since
all restaurants would be able to register, advertise and sell their food on the platform.
